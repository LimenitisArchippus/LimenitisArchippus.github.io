                <p><mark>
                    Founded in 1982 by the late Barq Wilson, Barqs Tree Planting and Forestry Service has always kept a dedication to ethical and sustainable practices. Barq grew up in the Kentucky wilderness, during the 1950s, where he fostered a love for the fauna of the area, leading him to becoming an advocate within the Kentucky legislature for environment protections and green energy solutions. After sustaining an injury to his spinal cord in a motor vehicle accident in 1975 causing permanent paralysis below his waist, he began the foundations for the company by starting multiple small environment protection groups within Kentucky and the surrounding states. He would then group them together under one company in 1980 named Green Lantern United. He very quickly changed the name to Barqs Tree Planting and Forestry Service after DC served him a cease and desist for copyright infringement on the Green Lantern name.

                <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
                <p><mark>
                    During his political career, Barq created multiple grants funded by the Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protections Agency that his new company was about to make use of. These gave him plenty of groundwork to merge his many organizations into a single, efficient and structured entity that allowed his operations to expand from out of the American South. Barqs Tree Planting and Forestry Service has been able to perform replanting efforts within the Brazilian Amazon and other South American Rainforests that have been heavy targets of deforestation. They have also been able to expand efforts domestically as well, having branch locations within each of the continental US states and Alaska. This, along with the creation of the volunteer program within the Branch available states has led to an increase of 6% of total forest growth within America within just 20 years.
