            <h1>Hello, I am Jonathan Pope</h1>
            <p>
                Hello, I am <span class="bold">Jonathan Pope</span>, an Idaho Native with an interest in programming, game development, and back end development. I find less enjoyment in front end development, but will do it as necessary.
                <br>
                I've been enrolled in computer science classes since my first semester of highschool, and have always preferred backend development as opposed to front end but i don't actually know why.
                <br>
                This may be because I do not like coding with HTML, but it could be other factors. My Father, however, is an active front end developer, making us opposites in coding styles.
                <br>
            </p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>My other interests include video games, motorcycles, and music.</p>

            <h3>Video Games and Career Aspirations</h3>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">Video Games</span> were a big part of my life growing up as it was for many children within my generation. The early 2000s leading into the early 2010s was a golden time for video games.
                <br>
                This has led me to have a great respect for the industry and I hope that I can one day create games of my own. However, game creation is not my career goal. If I were to go the academic route,
                <br>
                then I would love to go into particle physics or some form of chemistry. This is unlikely as I don't want to stay in school for 10 more years, but has been an idea I have entertained.
                <br>
                Another career idea that is a little more realistic for me, is to learn another language and work as a media translator, whether it be books, music, or TV. I did actively study Japanese in highschool
                <br>
                so it is in my interest to move to Japan. I went there previously for a school trip and loved it there. I do also have a general interest in linguistics and would be interested in seeking a degree in it.
            </p>

            <h3>Motorcycles and Two-Wheeled Transportation</h3>
            <p>
                A bit of a newer interest, starting this year, has been many forms of <span class="bold">Two-Wheeled Vehicles</span>. This includes motorcycles and other forms, such as electric scooters and electric bikes.
                <br>
                I have an electric scooter, named <span class="bold">Milo</span>, that I purchased back in May for $1300 that I loved. The fastest I got it was 48 miles per hour and was always enjoyable to ride.
                <br>
                It had many problems however, it was legally questionable to ride on the road(though I was never pulled over), it felt unstable at high speeds, and both of the stock motors have blown out at some point.
                <br>
                When the rear motor blew out, I replaced it, but this whole process took almost two months, through the diagnosis, part location, and replacement. This also cost me $400 in labor and parts.
                <br>
                When the front motor blew out, not even 5 weeks after the rear, it made no since to me to go through the whole process again. And so I purchased my first Motorcycle.
                <br>
                I went out and purchased a brand new Honda Navi, named <span class="bold">Ivan</span>, from a local dealership for $2900. Its a small bike, and some would consider it a scooter in a bike shell, but it has been very fun to ride. 
            </p>

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>
                I really like music and often will use it as background noise when doing many tasks. As I create this right now I am listening to Japanese Lo-Fi recommended to me by Apple Music.
                <br>
                I listen to many Genres of music, including Japanese soft-rock, Metal, Lo-Fi, and others, but metal is the genre that I most recently gotten into. I only got into it my Junior Year of high school.
                <br>
                At the time I was getting into heavier rock music like <span class="bold">Seether</span>(<span class="italic">Poison the Parish </span>and <span class="italic">Si Vis Pacem, Parra Bellum</span>) when my friend introduced me to a band called <span class="bold">Trivium</span>(<span class="italic">Silence in the Snow</span> to be particular).
                <br>
                And from there I got into more gateway bands such as <span class="bold">Breaking Benjamin</span>(<span class="italic">Phobia</span> and <span class="italic">Dear Agony</span>), <span class="bold">SpiritBox</span>(<span class="italic">Eternal Blue</span>), <span class="bold">The Devil Wears Prada</span>(<span class="italic">Color Decay</span>), and <span class="bold">Architects</span>(<span class="italic">For Those That Wish to Exist</span> and <span class="italic">The Classic Symptoms of a Broken Spirit</span>)
                <br>
                My top 5 favorite bands, in no particular order are:
            </p>
